I am creating this file using Nano.  I found it to be the simplest text editor to use for simple editing, though I just remembered that I'm not a fan of that it doesn't auto wrap.  But it's easy enough to fix. Mostly I like Nano cause it has that handy menu at the bottom of the window, which is super helpful for newbies. If I was to choose a number two it would be emacs, even though it drove me insane at first. It was the first one I tried and I definitely see that its a more flexible option with seemingly more features.
